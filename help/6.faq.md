# Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **How do I gain access to Geoclient?**

You need to have an App ID and an App Key to use the NYC Geoclient Service. If you work for NYC, you can send an email to `mlipper@doitt.nyc.gov` and request access. Otherwise, head over to the [API Developer Portal.](https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api) and request access.

2.  **How should my data be formatted?**

Your data should be some form of location data. Ultimately, the columns you supply and return values you request are contingent on the type of request being made. Check out the [Geoclient Docs](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc) for more helpful information.

2.  **One of the return values I requested came back empty, but no error was indicated. How do I fix this?**

You will need to confirm that you are supplying the correct input parameters for the type of request you are making. The API doesn't know how to retrieve that information if it doesn't have the right input. Check out the [Geoclient Docs](https://api.cityofnewyork.us/geoclient/v1/doc) for more helpful information.
